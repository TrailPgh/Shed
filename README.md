# Introduction

This web app is a Django/Python project intended to be used for 
any python-based code that TrailPgh wants to deploy.

Our first use will be GPS-related functionality.


## Shed: Where tools are stored

Python was chosen because its what Ricky already has some 
code written in, it's easy to install and use, its popular and free,
and its an excellent choice for data-related projects.

Django was chosen because it's a web framework that is easy to 
use and has a lot of documentation, it is popular and has a vast
community and ecosystem, and also because its a full-featured full-stack
web appplciation framework that includes tooling for not just HTTP handler
functions and UI templates, but also database models, authentication, an
ORM (object-relational mapper), and more. As opposed to Flask, which is a 
microframework, and does not include all the tooling that Django does.
